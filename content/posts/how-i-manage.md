I've been wanting to write down a sort of manifesto for how I lead and manage for a while now to summarize years of refining my style into a craft.

Today, I'm launching the ["manager docs"](/manager-docs) section of this site (along with this, its inaugural blog post).

The intention is to be a living, evolving document that formalizes my opinions and generalized processes so folks who are working with me know what they're getting themselves into.

[Check it now now](/manager-docs). And if you disagree, have questions, or want to send kudos, the source for these docs are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/cjcodes/cjcodes.com). PRs welcome!
