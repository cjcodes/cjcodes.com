So I'm one of those manager type folks. And I like it. I didn't stumble into it -- I intentionally chose to refine my leadership to a point where I can leverage that leadership to manage folks. I think of both leadership and management as a craft.

Implied above, I also think about leadership and management as two distinct skills. Leadership to me is driving execution and alignment. Management is the added accountability to that equation.

## Management Base Principles
To keep me honest, I'm committing to writing a blog post about each of these base principles in the future. But for now, they're helpful to list to get you in my head.

- Good management is an outcome of good leadership
- Good leadership is intentional and refined over time, not accidental and circumstantial
- Empowerment is both better and harder than delegation
- The players are more important than the game
- Great managers manage themselves up and out of their jobs
- Manager effectiveness is best quantified by their legacy, which is best measured in their absence
- Some of a manager's best work will likely receive zero credit
- Lead with empathy for your team members, your manager, and the business (and in that order)
