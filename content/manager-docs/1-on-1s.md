A 1:1 is always *your* meeting. My meetings are performance reviews and formal calendar invites. As always, others have written with more eloquence than I on the topic, so I [picked one for you](https://lattice.com/library/the-ultimate-guide-to-one-on-ones) that summarizes my approach.

## Format of a 1:1 doc
I like to have these categories in my 1:1 docs:

1. Prioritized topic backlog
2. Action items
3. Dated summary of items discussed

### 1. Backlog
The topic backlog is a dumping ground for things that come up during the week that you or I would like to discuss together. It's a place to put things like "Alice and Bob had a weird fight in their pull request this week, wtf was up with that" or "my learning feels like it's stagnated, what work can I take on to challenge me a bit more?"

This list of topics should be prioritized by what's most pressing, weighing on you the most, or is the most time-sensitive.

### 2. Action items
Here we'll hold each other accountable to what either of us will be doing to follow up on a topic we discussed. Every item in this list needs a feasible due date, and we will try to audit the action item list every check-in.

### 3. Dated summaries
When something from the backlog is discussed, move it to the dated summary so we have a record of your progress and growth.
