To be written. This page will outline what you can expect from me as your manager. Below is my working list that I'll add to over time.

- Radical transparency
- Thorough performance reviews and 100% clarity on the factors that impacted your performance review
- Estimate with a 1 year margin of error of when you'll be ready for your next promotion. (The precision decreases as you go beyond Staff level.)
- 24 hour response SLA to emails
- "Next free time" commitment to acknowledge Slack messages (SLA < 4 business hours)
- Evidence- and example-driven feedback
- No [feedback sandwiches](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/ban-the-feedback-sandwich-for-employee-feedback-1918465)
- Ad-hoc feedback when requested within 48 business hours
- ... more to come, along with better formatting
